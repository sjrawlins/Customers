# Customers
In a list/detail format, a simple Customer contact app, written in C# and running on Android, iOS, Windows and WinPhone.
Demonstrates iFactr's cross-platform framework which is built upon the open-source MonoCross.Navigation.
This app demonstrates MonoView (ListView and GridView), DataBinding, Search and Alerts.
There is no database backend and no network connection required.  Users can "Add" customers (and Edit and Delete), but changes are not permanent (just restart the app and the original list is still there).
